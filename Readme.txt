This is a task manager, u can add tasks, manage them
program automatically sorts them, so enjoy:)

To get started, run the task_manager_ui.py file
Please note, this was coded in python 3.7
Make sure you have pyqt5 installed, along with other submodules like json and datetime(they should have come with your python distro anyways:))
